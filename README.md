# dot Files

Welcome to my dotfiles, it will allow you to download my configuration for some aplications and implement a .local folder for some bin utilities and sources for DWM, ST, and other compile base apps.
It will also create some enviroment variables to organize the config files. 


## Apps used:
### - foot, it's a terminal emulator for wayland, config sets the trasparency and font size
### - Neovim, text editor, the config sets trasparency and line highlighting 
### - Sway, i3 equivalent for sway, the config sets some shortcuts and input options and a 5 minute screen off timer 
### - Zathura, PDF viwer that runs like lighting, the config adds the selected text to clipboard
### - Zsh is the shell I use, the config adds pretty colors to the ps1 and some useful aliases, remember to add the .cache directory so you have history in the terminal
